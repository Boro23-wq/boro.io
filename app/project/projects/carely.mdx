This project is a piece of a pie, me and my team members contributed to during the summer. There were 4-5 different teams including ours,
with 4-5 team members on each team that worked on various features of the
product.

## Overview

Carely was built as a set of enrollee-centered, goal-oriented, culturally relevant and logical steps to assure that an enrollee receives needed services in a supportive, effective, efficient, timely and cost-effective manner. Care management emphasizes prevention, continuity of care and coordination of care, which advocates for, and links enrollees to, services as necessary across providers and settings. At a minimum, care management functions must include, but are not limited to:

1. Early identification of enrollees who have or may have special needs;
2. Assessment of an enrollee's risk factors;
3. Development of a plan of care;
4. Referrals and assistance to ensure timely access to providers;
5. Coordination of care actively linking the enrollee to providers, medical services, residential, social, behavioral, and other support services where needed; 6. Monitoring;
6. Continuity of care; and,
7. Follow-up and documentation.

## Feature my team worked on

## Case Notes

Case Notes (Web portal) provides an efficient way of documenting and monitoring all the components, evaluations, and encounters between patients and health professionals. It is for case managers, caregivers, and patients to precisely gather and retain information about the customer. Case notes will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the services a customer receives.

It will display all related customer information including identification of needs and preferences, and scheduled appointments which create the visibility, patients and health professionals lack.

Unlike the traditional way of manually keeping records of patients. The case notes aim to automate and streamline the documentation and record-keeping process. It allows case managers to easily identify and analyze the customer profile which helps to precisely make decisions. Our product will serve as a reference tool to record and assist with administrative decision-making and case review and show the relations in current trends.

## Opportunity

Health might be considered the most important factor in human life. Therefore it is very important to be able to continuously track and document every aspect of it. Case notes serve as a running record and documentation of patientsâ€™ interaction with health providers to keep track of any information relevant to their treatment. Case managers are dedicated to serving the ever-changing requirements of their clients. As a result, case managers will keep track of clientsâ€™ progress, goals, and treatment responses in a case note.

## Product vision

A solution that drives the optimization of every facet of documenting components, evaluations, and encounters between patients and health professionals, evaluating the effectiveness of the services received by the patients, creating information visibility, promoting automated and streamline methods to identify and analyze customer profile in order to make precise and informed decisions.

## Resources

## API design

The case manager API design can be found [here](https://github.com/Boro23-wq/Case-Manager-API-Design), and link to the swagger API documentation can be found [here.](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/Boro23-wq/case-manager/1.0#/)

## API backend

The Case Manager API is built using the Active Record Pattern. Using the Active Record approach, one can define all their query methods inside the model itself, and save, remove, and load objects using model methods. Simply, the Active Record pattern is an approach to access database within the defined models.

The API backend can be found [here.](https://github.com/Boro23-wq/casenotesweb-backend)
